A fun and innovative focus-monitoring application that tracks head and pupil movements to ensure users stay attentive to their screens.

The application leverages SmolVLM, a lightweight vision-language model, to analyze on-screen content efficiently while running entirely on our own server. This setup ensures low latency and faster response times, making the experience seamless and reliable.

Designed and built in under 24 hours, the project demonstrates the effective integration of machine learning and computer vision with real-time monitoring capabilities, packaged in a user-friendly solution.
