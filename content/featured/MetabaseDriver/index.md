A Metabase driver for InterSystems IRIS that I developed during my internship, written in Clojure. It enables seamless data import from IRIS databases into Metabase for business intelligence and analytics.

The driver has since been merged into the official Metabase repository, making it available to the broader Metabase community (Commit #61431).
