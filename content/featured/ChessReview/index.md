As a passionate Chess.com user striving to improve my gameplay, I encountered a significant limitation: the platform restricts free users to just one Game Review per day. Rather than letting this limit my progress, I decided to take matters into my own hands by building a custom application.

Currently, Iâ€™m in the process of porting the application to a dedicated website, making it accessible to a broader audience and eventually transform it into a Chrome extension that integrates seamlessly with Chess.com
