Managed a team of 4 to design and build a minimart web app for the Muhammadiyah Welfare Home. The website enables administrators to manage items and assign tasks that reward residents with points. Residents can use these points to redeem items from a user-friendly storefront with real-time stock updates. Administrators are also able to create other admin accounts and add/suspend resident accounts without leaving the website allowing for it to be used by users without a technical background.
